/*
 * Placeholders, or format specifiers, play a crucial role in displaying
 * variable values within output statements in Java programming. By using
 * println along with String.format, you can control the formatting of the
 * displayed values, such as specifying the number of decimal places for
 * floating-point numbers or the width of integer values. Understanding and
 * utilizing placeholders correctly enhances the readability and presentation of
 * output in your Java programs.
