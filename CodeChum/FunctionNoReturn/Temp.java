/*
 * Introduction to Functions
 * Java, a widely-used object-oriented programming language, emphasizes
 * readability and simplicity. Functions in Java, typically known as methods,
 * are fundamental to its structure, enabling the development of modular,
 * reusable, and maintainable code. This guide will explore Java functions,
 * covering how to create and use them, understand parameters, and utilize the
 * return keyword effectively.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Introduction to Functions in Java
 * Functions, or methods in Java, are blocks of code designed to perform
 * specific tasks. They are integral for:
 * 
 * Modularity: Breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.
 * Code Reusability: Reducing redundancy by reusing code across different parts
 * of a program.
 * Ease of Maintenance: Simplifying the debugging and updating process.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Function Creation and Usage
 * Defining a Function
 * In Java, a function is defined within a class and has a return type, a name,
 * and parameters.
 * 
 * 
 * Calling a Function
 * To execute a function, you call it by its name using an instance of the class
 * (for non-static methods) or directly from the class (for static methods).
 * 
 * 
 * The return Keyword in Functions
 * The return keyword in Java methods specifies the value to be sent back to the
 * caller.
 * 
 * Returning Values: A method can return a value, including primitives, objects,
 * or nothing (void).
 * Control Flow: return can also be used to exit a method early.
 * 
 * 
 * Conclusion
 * Understanding and effectively using functions in Java is crucial for creating
 * organized and efficient applications. They form the backbone of Java's
 * object-oriented structure, facilitating powerful software solutions.
