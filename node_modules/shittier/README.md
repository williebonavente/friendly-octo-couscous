# üí© Shittier

**Shittier** is a code formatting tool that aims to make your code look as terrible as possible. It is the exact opposite of popular tools like Prettier, which focus on improving code formatting and readability. Shittier embraces chaos, messiness, and confusion, making your code look shittier than ever before.

With Shittier, you can expect the following:

- Random indentation for a chaotic code structure.
- Mixed case madness that breaks consistency.
- Spacing nightmares with added or removed spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
<!-- - Creative comment chaos with sarcastic or nonsensical remarks. -->
