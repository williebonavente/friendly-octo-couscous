 *       Problem No. 4
 *       Write a program that inputs the hourly rate and number of hours worked.
 *       Compute
 *       and display the gross pay (hourly rate * hours worked), your
 *       withholding tax, which is
 *       15% of your gross pay and your net pay (gross pay â€“ withholding tax).
 *       Sample output: Hourly rate: 104.65
 *       Hours worked: 22
